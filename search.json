The database search is broad, covering several academic databases (ACM Library, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, Scopus, Taylor & Francis, and Web of Science.) with detailed Boolean terms. The authors only included peer reviewed papers and the justification for the timeframe (2013–2023) is grounded in the literature on mobile learning phases (Cochrane, 2013). From an initial pool of 2,461 studies, 38 were included after applying the screening steps. However, our review raises concerns about how consistently the selection criteria were applied. After manually looking at the included studies, a small number of studies do not clearly specify the platform used, and several other studies show signs of using desktop environments rather than mobile devices. One study used an Xbox Kinect, which falls outside most definitions of mobile learning. These inconsistencies could suggest that some decisions during the selection process may not fully align with the study’s stated focus on mobile games or that the authors had more information at hand than we could gather from a simple reading of the papers.\nFulfilled: 60%",

(Generalizability)\nThe study includes 38 primary studies covering a wide variety of fields and educational levels, which supports the goal of offering broad, generalizable insights. However, one limitation is the number of studies that go into certain subgroup analyses. In several cases, reported interactions, such as specific combinations of game genres and moderators, are based on only a single study. For example, the strong effect of puzzle games in the field of education “social sciences, journalism, and information” category is drawn from just one data point. While these results are included transparently, the limited sample size in these subgroups reduces the reliability of those specific findings and means they should not be generalized without caution.

Regarding the procedure, the students first got an introduction to the “speed” unit, then the pre-tests and pre-questionnaires followed. After this they got an introduction to the learning activities and then separated into the two groups. At the end post-tests and post-questionnaires were deployed. Pre- and post-learning performance tests were developed by two teachers with many years of experience.
