    "text": "2. Study Selection\nThe study outlines its inclusion and exclusion criteria clearly and follows the PRISMA method. The database search is broad, covering several academic databases (ACM Library, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, Scopus, Taylor & Francis, and Web of Science.) with detailed Boolean terms. The authors only included peer reviewed papers and the justification for the timeframe (2013–2023) is grounded in the literature on mobile learning phases (Cochrane, 2013). From an initial pool of 2,461 studies, 38 were included after applying the screening steps. However, our review raises concerns about how consistently the selection criteria were applied. After manually looking at the included studies, a small number of studies do not clearly specify the platform used, and several other studies show signs of using desktop environments rather than mobile devices. One study used an Xbox Kinect, which falls outside most definitions of mobile learning. These inconsistencies could suggest that some decisions during the selection process may not fully align with the study’s stated focus on mobile games or that the authors had more information at hand than we could gather from a simple reading of the papers.\nFulfilled: 60%",

(Generalizability)\nThe study includes 38 primary studies covering a wide variety of fields and educational levels, which supports the goal of offering broad, generalizable insights. However, one limitation is the number of studies that go into certain subgroup analyses. In several cases, reported interactions, such as specific combinations of game genres and moderators, are based on only a single study. For example, the strong effect of puzzle games in the field of education “social sciences, journalism, and information” category is drawn from just one data point. While these results are included transparently, the limited sample size in these subgroups reduces the reliability of those specific findings and means they should not be generalized without caution.

Furthermore, stakeholders like teachers and game developers can look at this study to see how narrative-driven, interactive learning environments can significantly improve students’ motivation and performance when learning mathematics.",

It shows that considering only the features of mobile devices (e.g. mobility and connectivity) or games (mechanics, gameplay, etc.) is not a sufficient condition for achieving INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS 7293 positive learning effects. It is important to recognize that an adequate combination of mobile devices, employed within proper learning setting and guided by an adequate game design (including the suitable genre, mechanics, etc.), yields better learning performance. This study also shows that some educational mobile games might be more effective for specific fields or levels of education. In this context, several researchers (Dillenbourg et al., 2013; Dimitriadis et al., 2013) have stated that “orchestration” should occur between different components – namely technology, educational context, and users – to achieve compatible, efficient, and effective technology-enhanced learning. Therefore, to achieve such orchestration when using educational mobile games, more research and discussion should take place in this regard to deeply understand how they would be effective across several variables (not only those considered in this study). From a practical perspective, this study provides substantial evidence about which game genres in mobile learning would be more effective under which circumstances. Such findings can provide guidance to different stakeholders (e.g. developers, designers, and researchers) about the game genres to adopt and implement in their contexts, depending on various variables highlighted in this present study, for better learning performance.\n\n\nCritical Remarks\n\nA table listing all studies per moderator (e.g., genre, field, level) would improve transparency\nSimple moderator analyses (e.g., like for game genre) would be preferable in addition to complex interaction terms\nSome important variables were ignored, despite high residual heterogeneity\n\nTheoretical grounding of games\nGame quality and learner perception\n\n\n\n\nConclusion for Steakholders\n\nChoose game genres carefully!\nConsider the device and setting!\nDon’t assume all educational games work the same!",
