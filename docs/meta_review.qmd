## 1. How substantial are the effects? (Magnitude)

The meta-analysis reports a large overall effect size (g = 0.97), suggesting that educational mobile games have a significant positive effect on learning performance. Puzzle games showed the strongest impact (g = 1.32), with other genres like role-playing (g = 0.85), adventure games (g = 0.65), and action games (g = 0.71), also showing moderate to large effect sizes. The overall effects are both statistically and practically important and strengthen the case for game-based approaches in education.

## 2. How nuanced are the findings? (Articulation)

The meta-analysis from Tlili et al. (2024) focuses a large part on the detailed exploration of moderator variables. The authors analyze effects across a wide range of factors, including field of education, education level, learning setting, device type, intervention duration. These distinctions provide valuable insight into when and how mobile games are most effective. The study's relevance for educational practice is increased by the structured approach to moderator analysis, which allows differentiated conclusions rather than general recommendations.

## 3. How generalizable are the findings? (Generalizability)
 
The study includes 38 primary studies covering a wide variety of fields and educational levels, which supports the goal of offering broad, generalizable insights. However, one limitation is the number of studies that go into certain subgroup analyses. In several cases, reported interactions, such as specific combinations of game genres and moderators, are based on only a single study. For example, the strong effect of puzzle games in the field of education “social sciences, journalism, and information” category is drawn from just one data point. While these results are included transparently, the limited sample size in these subgroups reduces the reliability of those specific findings and means they should not be generalized without caution. To the authors credit, they mention this in their limitations. 

## 4. What is the scientific relevance of the study? (Impact)

This is one of the first meta-analyses to focus specifically on educational mobile games, to understand their effect in education.
It addresses a meaningful research gap by (i) examining education as a whole, rather than focusing on specific subjects like language learning or STEM, as in Su et al. (2021) and Gao et al. (2020); (ii) emphasizing learning performance rather than outcomes like motivation or knowledge gain, as seen in Schmitz et al. (2012); and (iii) concentrating specifically on mobile educational games, rather than just digital educational games as a whole.
The study also offers theoretical and practical information, which makes it especially helpful for various stakeholders who are interested in how mobile technologies can enhance learning, such as educators, instructional designers, and policymakers.

## 5. How credible is the methodology? (Credibility)

The meta-analysis follows established standards for systematic reviews, using the PRISMA protocol and statistical methods like Hedges’ g, I², and multiple techniques for publication bias detection (funnel plots, Egger’s regression and trim-and-fill methods). The coding of moderators is systematic and well-documented. 
That said, a few of the included studies raise questions about alignment with the stated inclusion criteria. From our understanding and research, a small number of studies did not clearly specify the type of device used or appeared to involve desktop environments rather than mobile platforms. These cases could have been screened more carefully, and they slightly reduce confidence in the “mobile-specific” focus of the findings.

## Conclusion for educational practice

Tlili et al. (2024) provide strong evidence that educational mobile games, especially puzzle-based ones, can positively influence student learning performance. The meta-analysis offers practical insights into what kinds of games work best, for which subjects, and under what conditions. At the same time, educators should keep in mind that some subgroup findings are based on very limited data, and that not all included studies were equally clear about the platform used. Still, the study is a valuable resource for guiding the use of mobile games in different educational contexts.
