all from Tapei Taiwan


## Critic

in the methods part it was stated that the game was very good and encuraged engagement -> should not be in the methods part

no information about the control group stimuli -> same videos as experimental group?, what was on the paper-based learning sheets? (same questions as in the game?) --> in discussion dann: „only needed to watch the video to collect information to answer individual questions on the learning sheet.“ 

cronbachs alpha was only assesed one time for each questionaire -> 12 cronbachs alpha would have been needed!, also not clear if it is overall or on pre- or on post!

no descriptoives in the results -> no Plot!

no baseline comaprisson -> assumption for ANCOVA!!! (i have to check if this really is an assumption for ANCOVA)

i would have liked a mixed ANOVA better, there you would have the baseline comparison (at least for the DV)
