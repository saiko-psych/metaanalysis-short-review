# Facilitating nursing students’ skill training in distance education via online game-based learning with the watch-summarize-question approach during the COVID-19 pandemic: A quasi-experimental study

Ching-Yi Chang, Min-Huey Chung, Jie Chi Yang 



## Summary: Enhancing Nursing Skill Training via Game-Based Learning

::: {.callout-note}
**Study Focus**  
This study investigates the effectiveness of integrating **online game-based learning (OGBL)** with the **watch-summarize-question (WSQ)** strategy to enhance skill acquisition in nursing students learning **sputum suction techniques** during remote education.
:::

### Background
- The COVID-19 pandemic forced a shift to online education, raising concerns over how to teach practical, hands-on clinical skills.
- Sputum suction is a critical nursing skill that, if performed incorrectly, can pose serious risks to patients.
- Traditional video-based methods lack the interactivity and engagement necessary for effective skill training.

## Methodology

::: {.callout-tip}
**Design:** Quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design  
**Participants:** 45 first-year nursing students  
**Groups:**
- **Experimental group:** Online game-based learning + WSQ strategy (n = 21)
- **Control group:** Traditional video-based learning (n = 24)  
**Platform Used:** Gather.town – a virtual interactive environment

**Duration:** Two weeks (2 sessions × 100 minutes)

## Results

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Learning Achievement
- Experimental group had significantly higher posttest scores (Adjusted Mean: 90.97) vs. control (64.40).
- Clear benefits observed from interactive, task-based game learning combined with reflection and questioning.

### Self-Efficacy
- Higher confidence levels in the experimental group (Mean: 4.74 vs. 3.84).
- Attributed to active participation, peer interaction, and repeated practice opportunities.

### Engagement & Satisfaction
- Students using OGBL + WSQ showed greater learning engagement and satisfaction.
- Increased interaction, competition, and scenario-based challenges contributed to improved outcomes.

## Discussion

::: {.callout-important}
The integration of **OGBL and WSQ**:
- Encouraged deep learning and critical thinking.
- Fostered collaboration and student interaction, which are often missing in remote settings.
- Supported self-regulated learning through structured reflection and peer discussion.
:::

This model not only improved short-term outcomes in sputum suction training but also showed potential for broader application in nursing education.

## Conclusion & Recommendations

::: {.callout-warning}
While the results were promising, the study notes:
- Resource demands for game development and scenario design.
- Small sample size and short duration limit generalizability.

**Recommendations:**
- Use free platforms like Gather for small groups.
- Collaborate with tech experts for game design.
- Consider applying the same model to other nursing procedures or interprofessional training.

## Critique

1. Missing information:

  - paper based learning sheet
  - intervention medium (desktop or mobile?)
  - gather environment
  - cronbachs alpha values
  - descriptive Statistics + baseline comparison

2. Missing third/fourth group (WSQ without gather/ gather without WSQ)

3. Not Open-Science (no Pre-Registration, no Open-Data)
