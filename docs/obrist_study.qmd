title: "A microworld-based role-playing game development approach to engaging students in interactive, enjoyable, and effective mathematics learning by Wang et al. (2018)"

## What did they do?

In this study, Wang et al. (2018) explored how a microworld-based role-playing game could help elementary school students learn mathematics more effectively and enjoyably. The researchers developed a digital game called "Speedy World", which was focused about a sixth-grade math unit on speed. The authors wanted to investigate if students who learned with the microworld-based gaming approach have significantly higher/better outcomes in Learning Achievement, Learning Motivation and Technology Acceptance compared to those who learned with the conventional technology enhanced learning approach.


## How did their game work?

The game was based on the classic story of The Tortoise and the Hare. Students took on the role of the tortoise, adjusting speed and time inputs in a simulated race to beat the hare. Through this interactive and explorative microworld, students could experiment, learn by doing, and solve practical problems in a gamified environment.

## How did they do it?

To test its effectiveness, the researchers conducted a quasi-experiment with 107 sixth graders in Taiwan. Half of the students used the microworld-based game, while the other half learned through a conventional technology-enhanced approach—a more structured, non-interactive online learning platform. Regarding the procedure, the students first got an introduction to the "speed" unit, then the pre-tests and pre-questionnaires followed. After this they got an introduction to the learning activities and then separated into the two groups. At the end post-tests and post-questionnaires were deployed. 
Pre- and post-learning performance tests were developed by two teachers with many years of experience. To investigate the Learning Motivation they adopted a questionnaire developed by Hwang and Chang (2011) and for the Technology Acceptance questionnaire the authors adopted the work from Hwang et al. (2013).

## Results

The authors could find significant results. Students in the game-based group showed higher learning achievement, greater motivation, and stronger technology acceptance. They not only performed better on post-tests, but also rated the system as easier and more useful than traditional digital tools.

## Why is it relevant?

This study highlights the potential of well-designed educational games, especially those rooted in microworlds and storytelling, to make math learning more engaging and effective.Their findings are also consistent with prior work (Mayer et al., 2003; Chen & Hwang, 2014). Furthermore, stakeholders like teachers and game developers can look at this study to see how narrative-driven, interactive learning environments can significantly improve students’ motivation and performance when learning mathematics.
